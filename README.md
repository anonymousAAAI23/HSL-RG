This is the implementation of the HSL-RG model in our paper "Few-shot Molecular Property Prediction via Hierarchically Structured Learning on Relation Graphs"

## Datasets

We use the processed data in [<sup>1</sup>](#par). Please download their data ,unzip the file and put the resultant folders in ```data```.

## Training and evaluation

```run.sh```  is the script for training and evaluation on the 1-shot setting of SIDER.


## Acknowledgement

We use the open-source code of "Property-Aware Relation Networks for Few-Shot Molecular Property Prediction"[<sup>1</sup>](#par) for the MAML framework.
